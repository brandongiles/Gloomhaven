    "There are three validation checks we need to do on each hand combination that was passed into the previous array in order to evaluate if it's a legitimate hand or not:\n",

    "    - This is done by assigning each card in the combination it's level, so a level 1 card gets a 1, level 2 a 2, etc.\n",
    "    - The sum of the array's level values then needs to be lower than the max value given by the following formula:\n",
    "        - Max value formula = ((([1] + [Level])*[Level])/2) + ([Hand Size] - [Level])\n",
    "        - Ex: For the Brute class, when evaluating hand combinations at level 2's selection time:\n",
    "            - (((1+2)*2)/2) + (10-2)\n",
    "            - 3 + 8 = 11\n",
    "        - Intuitively, this makes sense as at level 1, the Brute class would have 10 level 1 cards for a total of 10\n",
    "        - At level 2, at most, you would select one level 2 card and replace a level 1 card with it\n",
    "        - That would replace a 1 value with a 2, taking the max value possible up to 11\n",
    "        - If we ever run into a class that has a hand size lower than 8, this formula will need to be tweaked\n",
    "            - This is because at a hand size of 8, you could remove a level 1 card for each level up\n",
    "            - At a hand size of 7 or lower, the top level ups would mean you need to replace a card value over 1\n",
    "        \n",
    "2. At the level being evaluated, each hand combination can only have one of the level cards\n",
    "    - When leveling up, you can initially only select a single card for the given level\n",
    "    - This will filter out any combinations that load in something like two level 2 cards when evaluating level 2\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. The amount of cards over level 1 in the hand cannot exceed then evaluation level minus 1\n",
    "    - This is because you can only make one card selection every time you level up\n",
    "    - It is allowed for you to take a card lower than the level you're on, for example taking the 2nd lvl 2 card at level 3's promotion rather than a level 3\n",
    "    - You cannot though have something like both level 2 cards AND a level 3 card at level 3\n",
    "    - As the levels get higher, there are ways to make summation combinations that fall meet conditions 1 and 2 but use more cards > level 1 than is permitted"
